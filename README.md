# Spark Hello World

Experimenting with Spark...

TODO:
 - [WIP] Split projects
   - Re-enable creation of docker containers?
 - Monitoring with Prometheus [pull](https://github.com/andrusha/dropwizard-prometheus) or [push](https://github.com/banzaicloud/spark-metrics) models.
 - How should we log?
 - How should we pass configuration? http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html
 - Structure code properly
