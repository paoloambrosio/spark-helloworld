# Spark Hello World

Experimenting with Spark...

TODO:
 - [WIP] Split projects, use Kafka for streaming example (using structured streaming?!), add Kafka to Docker Compose
 - Monitoring with Prometheus [pull](https://github.com/andrusha/dropwizard-prometheus) or [push](https://github.com/banzaicloud/spark-metrics) models.
 - How should we log?
 - Structure code properly
